## Hello!

I'm Sandra Romero Pinto. I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Harvard University, in the [SHBT](https://shbtphd.hms.harvard.edu/) program of the [Division of Medical Sciences](https://gsas.harvard.edu/programs-of-study/divisions/division-medical-sciences). 

I'm advised by [Naoshige Uchida](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/uchidalab/home). I'm interested in *learning*, and in particuliar, how we learn to link a certain value (or utility) to elements we encounter in our environment,  how our model of the world becomes influenced or constrained by this subjective utility, and how animals orient their actions towards maximizing their subjective utility.  My research  applies concepts of reinforcement learning, economics, and computational psychiatry, into trying to understand the neurobiology of learning. I was recently awarded the [Albert J. Ryan Fellowship](http://www.albertjryanfoundation.org/fellows.cfm) by Harvard Medical School due to my dissertation research.

Previously, I did a Master of Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/life-sciences-engineering/), where I spend two years learning about neuroenineering and neuroprosthetics, and also developed some fun projects. I was awarded the [Bertarelli Fellowhip for Translational Neuroscience and Neuroengineering](https://bertarelli.hms.harvard.edu/people/sandra-romero-pinto) to develop my masters thesis at Harvard Medical School, where I worked with [Daniel Polley](https://scholar.harvard.edu/polleylab/people/daniel-b-polley-phd).

Before that, I did a Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering, in between [Politecnico di Milano](https://www2.polimi.it/index.html%3Fid=9025&L=1.html) and [Tecnologico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en/innovation-and-transformation/bs-in-biomedical-engineering). 

Also! I'm from Peru and I grew up very near the Pacific Ocean. It should be mentioned that I'm slightly addicted to surfing.
