Thanks for dropping by!

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Harvard University, in the SHBT program of the Division of Medical Sciences. I was recently awarded the Albert J. Ryan Fellowship by Harvard Medical School.

I'm advised by Naoshige Uchida, whose lab is where I perform my dissertation research. I'm interested in *learning*, and in particuliar, how  we learn to associate a certain value (or utility) to elements we encounter in our environment, and how the model of the world we learn, becomes influenced or constrained by our subjective utility.  My research  applies concepts of  economics, reinforcement learning and computational psychiatry, in the neuroscience of learning. 

Previously I did a Master of Science in Bioengineering at EPFL, where I spend some time learning about neuroenineering and neuroprosthetics, and also developed some fun projects.
Before that, I did a Bachelor in Biomedical Engineering, in between Politecnico di Milano and Tecnologico de Monterrey.
